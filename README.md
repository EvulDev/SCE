# SCE
This is a Simulated Civilian Evacuation Script for Arma 3.

The idea behind the script is to simulate a civlian evacuation of one or thusands of civilians. The civlians is stored as a number pool and each evacuation run will drag from this stored number untill the civilian zone is empty.

In addition the script should handle incoming ordinance or fire within the civilian zone and randomly calculate a civlian deaths. This also aplies to trucks or helicopters handeling the evacuation.
