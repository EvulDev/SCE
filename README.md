# Simulated Civilian Evacuation (SCE)
This is a Simulated Civilian Evacuation Script for Arma 3.

The idea behind the script is to simulate a civilian evacuation of one or thousands. The civilians is stored as a virtual pool and each evacuation run will subtract from this pool until the zone is empty.

In addition the script should handle incoming ordinance or fire within the civilian zone and randomly calculate civilian casualties. This also applies to trucks and helicopters handling the evacuation taking fire.
