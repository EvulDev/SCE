# SCE
This is a Simulated Civilian Evacuation Script for Arma 3.

The idea behind the script is to simulate a civlian evacuation of one or thusands. The civlians is stored as a virtual pool and each evacuation run will drag from this pool untill the zone is empty.

In addition the script should handle incoming ordinance or fire within the civilian zone and randomly calculate a civlian deaths. This also applies to trucks or helicopters handeling the evacuation taking fire.
